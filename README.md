# Employee Attrition Prediction 🧑‍💼📊

## Project Overview
Employee attrition is a critical challenge for organizations, as high turnover rates lead to increased recruitment costs and loss of valuable expertise.  
This project aims to build a **Machine Learning model** that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company based on historical HR data.

The solution helps HR departments take **proactive actions** to improve employee retention and reduce turnover costs.

## Problem Statement
Employee attrition negatively impacts productivity, team stability, and overall business performance.  
The objective of this project is to develop a **predictive model** that can identify employees at risk of leaving the organization.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze employee data to identify key factors contributing to attrition  
- Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models  
- Select the best-performing model for prediction  
- Provide insights to support data-driven HR decisions  

---

## Dataset
